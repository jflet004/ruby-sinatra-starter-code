## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

This repository has all the starter code needed to get a Sinatra backend up and
running. Fork and clone this repository to get started. Then, run
`bundle install` to install the gems.

**Important**: Be sure you fork a copy of the repo into your GitHub account
before cloning it. You can do this by clicking the "Octocat" button at the top of this 
page, then clicking "Fork" in the upper right corner of the repo page.

The `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` file has an example GET route
handler. Replace this route with routes for your project.

You can start your server with:

```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```

This will run your server on port
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).
